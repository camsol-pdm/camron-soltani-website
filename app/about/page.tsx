              I joined Fyxt as a QA Analyst (March 2018) when the company was early stage. Over the next 8 years, I evolved into Co-Founder & Product Manager (January 2020–present), wearing multiple hats and driving strategic initiatives end-to-end.

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-spotify-text mb-4">Why This Role Excites Me</h2>
          <div className="space-y-4 text-spotify-text-muted leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              I've been drawn to the creator economy for the past 3–4 years. I listen to 15+ podcasts per week, and I've noticed a clear pattern: the most innovative, best-quality creators are often the most frustrated with discovery, monetization, and analytics tools available to them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Spotify is uniquely positioned. It has 678M logged-in users, a proven ads business, and genuine relationships with creators through Spotify for Creators. But the tools for podcast discovery, promotion, and creator growth still lag behind music—and significantly lag YouTube.
            </p>
            <p>
              That gap is where I want to focus my energy. If I can help Spotify build a creator-first podcast growth engine that simplifies promotional planning, measurement, and optimization, it's not just about retention and revenue; it's about democratizing podcast creation and helping the next generation of storytellers build sustainable careers in audio.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the intersection of product strategy, creator empathy, data-driven optimization, and AI integration—this is where I want to spend the next few years.

              <p>I'm an avid rockhound with a collection of opals, agates, and rare specimens. I spend weekends exploring tide pools and rock formations in Palos Verdes, near my home in Redondo Beach, CA. There's something meditative about analyzing mineral structures and understanding geological patterns—not unlike diagnosing product problems.</p>
